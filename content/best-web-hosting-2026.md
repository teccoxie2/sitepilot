## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between shared and VPS hosting?

Shared hosting puts multiple websites on the same server, sharing resources like CPU and RAM. VPS hosting gives you dedicated resources within a virtual private server. VPS is faster and more reliable but costs more.

### How much should I spend on web hosting?

For most small businesses and personal sites, $5-15/month provides excellent hosting. Only upgrade to premium hosting ($20+/month) if you have specific performance requirements or high traffic.

### Do I need managed or unmanaged hosting?

Beginners should choose managed hosting where the provider handles server maintenance, security updates, and technical issues. Unmanaged hosting requires server administration skills.

### Can I switch hosting providers later?

Yes, most hosts offer free migration services. However, switching can cause temporary downtime, so choose carefully from the start.
